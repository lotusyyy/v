 * Compares two tasks by precedence of category -> priority -> name and returns
 * an integer referring to their relative ordering
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *     t1 - The first task to compare
 *     t2 - The second task to compare
 *
 * Returns:
 *     a negative integer if t1 belongs before t2
 *     a positive integer if t1 belongs after t2
 *     0 if the tasks are identical (This should never happen in your program)
